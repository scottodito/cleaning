==================================================================

This directory contains the week 4 assignment with original data set.

The file to process the raw data is called 'run_analysis.R' 
(the data folder is assumed to exist, however it will download if needed)

It is assumed that you have installed or can download and install the dplyr package

To run the process you can simply source the file 

```source('run_analysis.R')```

This will output the tidy data set found in file 'tidy_data.txt'
